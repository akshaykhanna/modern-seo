# Getting Set Up

There are a few things you need to ensure you have installed, in order to be ready for this course.

### Node.js

You’ll need a relatively recent version (v4.5 or newer, *latest stable version* ideally) of node.js installed. On OS X, a great way of doing this without disturbing your existing dev environment is to install NVM. [Installation instructions are here](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation).

You’ll know everything is set up properly when you can run

```
nvm --version # might look like "0.31.4"
node --version # might look like "v7.7.3"
```

### Visual Studio Code

Particularly if you’ve never tried it before, you should install [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Some fantastic extensions that I use regularly include
* [vscode-icons](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=robertohuertasm.vscode-icons)
* [Sublime Text Keymap](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.sublime-keybindings) - Install if you’re used to sublime text keyboard shortcuts


# How to use it
